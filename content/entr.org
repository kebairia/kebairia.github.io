Long ago, i came across a tool called [[http://eradman.com/entrproject/][entr]], and it's a pretty cool program actually.

What does is really simple, but yer powerfull, it let you run any of commands when a specific files changes

let's take example to grasp the idea:
#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
  ls | entr make install 
#+end_src

* My use case
lately, i started get frustrated from a workflow that i was following.

it  began with latex and it the rebuilding that i used to do every time i change my =.tex= files.
But i managed to solve this problem with the =latexmk= command since it has its way of monitoring the =.tex= files, 
and rebuilding the output =pdf= file.\\
#+begin_note
You can check my [[https://github.com/kebairia/org-master][org-master]] repo which contain my latex/org build.
#+end_note
But when i started this blog, the problem came to appear again.
** The old workflow
the old workflow that i used to follow is to create chunks of section of the blog, then rebuilding the whole 
blog using a simple script '=build.sh=', and i was doing that manually ðŸ˜‘.
** My new workflow
#+begin_src makefile
.PHONY: clean

publish:
	./build.sh
clean:
	rm -rf public
watch:
	find -iname "*.org" | entr ./build.sh
#+end_src
and than i use =make watch=. And that's it ðŸ˜€.
