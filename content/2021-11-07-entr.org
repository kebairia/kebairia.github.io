Long ago, I came across a tool called [[http://eradman.com/entrproject/][entr]], and it's a pretty cool program actually.
What it does is really simple, but yet powerful, it let you run any arbitrary set of commands when a specific files changes.\\

The [[http://eradman.com/entrproject/][entr's website]] has a great explanation for it with a bunch of great examples to start with.\\
But long story short, you pass a set of files (using regex for example) to the command through =stdin=, and then make it run
a script or a command whenever one of these file changes.\\
For example, here I make it monitor any =markdown= files in my current directory, and execute a script that commit and pushes the changes
i made automatically.
#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
  find -iname "*.md" | entr commit-and-push.sh
#+end_src
* My use case
I can think of numerous use cases and scenarios in which this utility may be quite useful, but for the time being,
I'm integrating it into my blog writing workflow.

#+begin_note
[[https://orgmode.org/][org mode]] is a markdown language and a major mode for Emacs
#+end_note

Before i publish any blog online, I use a small local web server to see the output result locally .
Of course I use Emacs and [[https://orgmode.org/][org mode]] to create my own blog posts, and I use another Emacs package called 
[[https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-web-server][simple-httpd]] to create a simple web server --- as the name implies! --- .

The issue I was having was that I had to rebuild the =html= files from the =org= files every time I wanted to see the output.
I wrote a simple shell script to accomplish this, but still, you need to run it manually.

You can see now how *entr* can fits into this workflow.
Why don't I use *entr* to monitor my =org= files and make it run the =build.sh= script whenever I make a change ðŸ˜€?

#+begin_src sh :results output
  find . -iname "*.org" | entr ./build.sh
#+end_src

And that's it, it's that simple.\\
All I have to do now is to write my posts, save them, and then reload the web page to see the results.\\
Wonderful.
